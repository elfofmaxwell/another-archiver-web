# another-archiver-web

Yet another web app shares some functions with another-archiver.

## About This Site

This is an archive station for Suisei Hoshimachi, a virtual YouTuber famous for her beautiful voice and inspirational experience. The target of this site is to prevent her videos from being deleted on YouTube due to copyright claims or any other unpredictable circumstances. The idea to build this site is inspired by Mr. Aozaki, an admirable Hoshiyomi (fan of Miss Hoshimachi). This new site aims a better tag management system and better searching experience.

Please do not advertise this site or use spider to massively download videos, thank you very much for your cooperation.

## This Project

This site is built with Flask/Angular/Bootstrap. The site also has a timed video fetcher based on yt-dlp.
