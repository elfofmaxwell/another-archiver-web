                This is an archive station for Suisei Hoshimachi, a virtual YouTuber famous for her beautiful voice and inspirational experience. The target of this site is to prevent her videos from being deleted on YouTube due to copyright claims or any other unpredictable circumstances. The idea to build this site is inspired by Mr. Aozaki, an admirable Hoshiyomi (fan of Miss Hoshimachi).
